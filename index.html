    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <h3>Education Background</h3>
    <p>I attended highschool at The State House Girls High School from 2012 to 2016. In
      2017, I was able to join the university where I pursued a bachelor of science in 
      computer science for four years.</p>
    <h3>Work History</h3>
    <p>While at the university, I volunteered at Upande Limited as a newsletter designer 
      for about three months. In addition, during my senior year at the university, I was 
      also able to work as an intern at Upande Limited as a website designer using wordpress.</p>
    <h3>Why I decided to take a class on programming</h3>
    <p>I discovered how much more I needed to learn after I finished the university. I 
      wanted to learn programming languages and specialize in software development. So I went 
      on the hunt for a reputable institution where I could study coding, and Moringa School 
      seemed the perfect fit. My first week has taught me that being self-motivated and having 
      solid time management skills are essential for progress.</p>
    <h3>My Interests</h3>
    <p>Some of my interests in order of preference include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Practising coding by doing more projects to improve my skills.</li>
      <li>Reading tech articles to learn about upcoming tech.</li>
      <li>Whenever I am free, I enjoy taking a walk, listening to music and
        sometimes catch up on the latest series or movies.</li>
    </ol>
